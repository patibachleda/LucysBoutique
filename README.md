## Online Commerce Store | Patrycja Bachleda

### Summary
##### A commerce website for a small boutique that allows the owner to login, upload pictures and a description, and upload selected items to their website. This information is stored in a database and then sorted according by category for a visitor to browse and then buy through PayPal generated checkout
### Objective
#### This project was completed to practice HTML, CSS, and SQL skills. It also allowed me to explore PHP and the transfer of data between pages.

### This application can not be hosted through GitHub pages as it relies heavily on PHP and SQL database management.
